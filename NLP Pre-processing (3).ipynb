    "## The Purpose of NLP Pre-Processing\n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) is often thought of as one of the main areas in Artificial Intellegence.  NLP techniques are at the core of AI-based products we use every day - chat bots, Google Translate, article summarizers, and the like.  However, NLP actually sits at the crossroads of AI/CS and computational linguistics - it's applications are more widespread than the obvious applications listed above.  NLP techniques allow us to derive things as complex as sentiment from text data, or to find patterns in text for any number of applications (fraud detection, topic segmentation, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is characterized as a difficult problem in computer science, due mostly to the ambiguity of human language. Human speech is seldom precise or direct.  Understanding natural language means you need to understand the concepts beneath the words, how they go together, and how the words/order/concepts come together to create meaning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before embarking on any NLP techniques (i.e. Sentiment Analysis) we need to make sure the text data is in the proper format.\n",
    "If not, the text won't be accepted into any models or processes.  Transforming your text data into something that an algorithm is able to ingest can be complicated, and it's helpful to have a solid grasp on the text data you're working with.  Generally, there are four stages within NLP pre-processing:\n",
    "- ##### Cleaning  \n",
    "Just like with non-text data, cleaning involves excluding the irrelevant or corrupt data points.  In NLP, this typically consists of removing stop words, punctuation, and other extraneous text.  Other cleaning tasks might involve dealing with capitalization rules, or other non-alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "- ##### Annotation  \n",
    "Typically annotation include things like parts-of-speech (POS) tagging, and is generally thought of as the application of a scheme to text data.\n",
    "- ##### Normalization  \n",
    "The translation or mapping or text within the scheme through Stemming, Lemmatization, or another method of standardization.\n",
    "- ##### Analysis  \n",
    "Applying basic statistical techniques to manipulate the data for more in depth analysis."

    "## Tools and Methods\n",
    "There are a lot methods and tools available for pre-processing text data. This article is meant to give you a starting point, and is not an exhaustive list of all the options available. Like with all data analysis, the analyst must understand the drawbacks and best uses of each technique and choose a method appropriate for the given dataset. The two main Python packages for NLP are `spaCy` and `NLTK` - both have pros and cons.  `NLTK` is highly customizable, but wasn't built to be quick and simple.  `spaCy`, on the other hand, was designed specifically with efficiency in mind and as such is quick and easy to use.

    "Tokenization is used for splitting sentences into individual words and/or splitting paragraphs into sentences. Splitting sentences into individual words and punctuation is most often done by splitting across white space or punctuation. This might cause problems when you're working with abbreviations, possessives, or proper nouns that use puntuation (like O'Brien or Sackville-West).  Splitting paragraphs into sentences accurately is equally challenging, largely due to the ambiguity of puntuation in the English language. The period alone can be used to denote the end of a sentence, an abbreviation, or be included in an email address. To accurately identify the boundaries of sentences a pre-trained algorithm, like NLTK's Punkt Models, should be used."

There are a variety of models available for stemming, including Porter and Snowball. The main drawback to stemming is that words are often overstemmed to the point of uselessness. This happens when words are structurally similar but have vastly different meanings (i.e. \"universe\" and \"university\" both stem to \"univers\"). Since stemming doesn't take into consideration the inflection it's removing, this technique can be useful if you're planning to match words based on origin but really not for much else."

    "Lemmazation is an alternative to stemming, that (at least for the NYCDOE text data that I work with) gets better results. Lemmazation is a more intensive process involving POS tags, which is more accurate than stemming.  For example, broken/ADJ yields broken but broken/VERB yields break. This increased accuracy comes at a slight time cost, but I've found this to be worth the trade off even for very large datasets.  Generally, lemmazatiztion is a better choice when trying to determine sentiment or do any sort of linguistic analysis. One thing to keep in mind is, as you'll see below, lemmas are lowercase."

    "While this is definitely not an exhaustive list of pre-proccessing techniques, preparing raw text data for analysis is a complicated process which requires the analyst to choose the optimal tools given both the data and the question being asked. Packages like `spaCy` and `NLTK` offer some great off the shelf funtions, though you may need to manually alter the default parameters or lists for best results. Once you've prepped your data you can go on to apply a variety of machine learning techniques depending on what the questions you're asking in regard to the text data."
