    "## The Purpose of NLP Pre-Processing\n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) is often thought of as one of the main areas in Artificial Intellegence.  NLP techniques are at the core of AI-based products we use every day - chat bots, Google Translate, article summarizers, and the like.  However, NLP actually sits at the crossroads of AI/CS and computational linguistics - it's applications are more widespread than the obvious applications listed above.  NLP techniques allow us to derive things as complex as sentiment from text data, or to find patterns in text for any number of applications (fraud detection, topic segmentation, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is characterized as a difficult problem in computer science, due mostly to the ambiguity of human language. Human speech is seldom precise or direct.  Understanding natural language means you need to understand the concepts beneath the words, how they go together, and how the words/order/concepts come together to create meaning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before embarking on any NLP techniques (i.e. Sentiment Analysis) we need to make sure the text data is in the proper format.\n",
    "If not, the text won't be accepted into any models or processes.  Transforming your text data into something that an algorithm is able to ingest can be complicated, and it's helpful to have a solid grasp on the text data you're working with.  Generally, there are four stages within NLP pre-processing:\n",
    "- ##### Cleaning  \n",
    "Just like with non-text data, cleaning involves excluding the irrelevant or corrupt data points.  In NLP, this typically consists of removing stop words, punctuation, and other extraneous text.  Other cleaning tasks might involve dealing with capitalization rules, or other non-alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "- ##### Annotation  \n",
    "Typically annotation include things like parts-of-speech (POS) tagging, and is generally thought of as the application of a scheme to text data.\n",
    "- ##### Normalization  \n",
    "The translation or mapping or text within the scheme through Stemming, Lemmatization, or another method of standardization.\n",
    "- ##### Analysis  \n",
    "Applying basic statistical techniques to manipulate the data for more in depth analysis."

    "## Tools and Methods\n",
    "There are a lot methods and tools available for pre-processing text data. This article is meant to give you a starting point, and is not an exhaustive list of all the options available. Like with all data analysis, the analyst must understand the drawbacks and best uses of each technique and choose a method appropriate for the given dataset. The two main Python packages for NLP are `spaCy` and `NLTK` - both have pros and cons.  `NLTK` is highly customizable, but wasn't built to be quick and simple.  `spaCy`, on the other hand, was designed specifically with efficiency in mind and as such is quick and easy to use.

    "### Capitalization\n",
    "Text data typically contains a various capitalizations - the beginning of sentences, proper nouns, etc.  The most common approach is to reduce everything to lower case, though this can sometimes affect the fidelity of your data - changing something like \"US\" to \"us\" can alter the meaning or affect how the string is tagged (this is where that inside knowledge of the data you're working with and the analysis you're running comes in handy).\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Stop Words  \n",
    "Most words within text data are connectors, which do little to show the subject, object, or other information within a sentence. Depending on the type of analysis you're running, excluding these stop words is a necessary step.  Stop words are equivilant to noise within the data.  There are pre-fab stop words lists out there, which can be used as is or altered to fit your particular data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Tokenization  \n",
    "Tokenization is used for splitting sentences into individual words and/or splitting paragraphs into sentences. Splitting sentences into individual words and punctuation is most often done by splitting across white space or punctuation. This might cause problems when you're working with abbreviations, possessives, or proper nouns that use puntuation (like O'Brien or Sackville-West).  Splitting paragraphs into sentences accurately is equally challenging, largely due to the ambiguity of puntuation in the English language. The period alone can be used to denote the end of a sentence, an abbreviation, or be included in an email address. To accurately identify the boundaries of sentences a pre-trained algorithm, like NLTK's Punkt Models, should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parts of Speech Tagging\n",
    "Parts of Speech (POS) tags are useful for understanding the meaning of a sentence, or identifying speech patterns in text. POS tagging typically entails looking at the neighboring words using either a stochastic or rule absed method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Stemming\n",
    "Stemming is a process where words are reduced to their root, removing whatever inflextion is present.  This is done by removing unnecessary characters, usually the suffix. There are a variety of models available for stemming, including Porter and Snowball. The results can be used to identify relationships and commonalities across data. The main drawback to stemming is that sometimes words are overstemmed to the point of uselessness. This happens when words are structurally similar but have vastly different meanings (i.e. \"universe\" and \"university\" both stem to \"univers\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Lemmatization\n",
    "Lemmazation is an alternative to stemming, that (at least for the NYCDOE text data that I work with) gets better results. Lemmazation is a more intensive process involving POS tags, which is often more accurate than stemming.  This increased accuracy comes at a slight time cost, so depending on your dataset and what's you're looking to extract from the text, consider what trade off is acceptable for you.  Generally, stemming is more appropriate for text queries whereas lemmazatiztion is a better choice when trying to determine sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word Counts \n",
    "One of the more basic, but still powerful, tools for feature engineering is to calculate word, sentence, punctuation, and keyword counts. Again, this is where that knowledge of your data will serve you well - you can create your own list of keywords and then calculate the count of those specific words to store as a feature.  "

    "\n",
    "While this is definitely not an exhaustive list of pre-proccessing techniques, preparing raw text data for analysis is a complicated process which requires the analyst to choose the optimal tools given both the data and the question being asked. Packages like `spaCy` and `NLTK` offer some great off the shelf funtions, though you may need to manually alter the default parameters or lists for best results. Once you've prepped your data you can go on to apply a variety of machine learning techniques depending on what the questions you're asking in regard to the text data."
